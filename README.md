# Titanic_Passenger_Survival_Prediction_Using_Linear_Regression_ML_Model
Used Linear Regression ML algorithm and trained the model with the data set of on-board Titanic passengers' (around 630 passengers) information and along with data
related to their survival.
This model was then able to predict the survival probability of any given passenger with 76% accuracy rate initially (increased gradually to above 91%).
